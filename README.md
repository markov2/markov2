Greetings from The Netherlands

Some of my work can be found here, as @markov2, but I have made much more code since I learned to program back in 1978.

You may be able to hire me for short projects (max 2 weeks) related to my work, because I am self-employed.
See my company website [MarkOv Solutions](https://solutions.overmeer.net) and
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/markovermeer).

Questions about my software?  Don't hessitate to mail me at mark@overmeer.net
