Greetings from The Netherlands

Some of my work can be found here, as @markov2, but I have made much more code since I learned to program back in 1978.

Please support my work via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/MarkOvOpenSource) or
[Buy Me A Coffee](buymeacoffee.com/markov.solutions)  More sponsoring
options on [my sponsor page](https://markov.solutions/sponsor/index-en.html).

You may be able to hire me for short projects (max 3 weeks) related to my work, because I am self-employed.
See my company website [MarkOv Solutions](https://solutions.overmeer.net) and
